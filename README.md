# SurviveTheGhouls
First person shooter game that i developed in Unity. Survive against the ghouls.

The objective of the game is to survive against waves of incoming ghoul hordes for as long as possible. You find yourself trapped in a small house surrounded by fences, with ghouls running towards you. Collect ammo from the ground and fight as long as you can to break your own survival record. How many waves can you survive?

Note: Shooting from the head deals more damage on enemies. Try to use your bullets efficiently!
