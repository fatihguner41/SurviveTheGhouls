# SurviveTheGhouls

Survive The Ghouls is a game where the goal is to fight against zombies and survive for as long as possible. I developed this game entirely on my own using free assets. The purpose of developing this game is not to make any income but to educate myself and gain experience in game development.

You can download and play the game from this link = https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l5ftdtqlk6zdjpbRyQV4nTYjmlHX2su-/view?usp=sharing

You can view all the scripts i've written during the development stage in the file named "Scripts".

First person shooter game that i developed in Unity. Survive against the ghouls.

The objective of the game is to survive against waves of incoming ghoul hordes for as long as possible. You find yourself trapped in a small house surrounded by fences, with ghouls running towards you. Collect ammo from the ground and fight as long as you can to break your own survival record. How many waves can you survive?

Note: Shooting from the head deals more damage on enemies. Try to use your bullets efficiently!
